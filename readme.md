# Awesome affordable methods for LLM reasoning in engineering

This is a collection of research papers & blogs for affordable methods capable of enhancing reasoning ability of LLM .

And the repository will be continuously updated to track the frontier of LLM Reasoning.

## Papers
* 18 Nov 2024 [ReST-MCTSâˆ—: LLM Self-Training via Process Reward
Guided Tree Search](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/publications/NeurIPS24-Zhang-et-al-ReST-MCTS.pdf#:~:text=traces%20as%20well%20as%20per-step%20value%20to%20train,is%20able%20to%20infer%20the%20correct%20process%20reward)
This work use mcts to enhance the capability of reasoning. It is remarkable that in their github repo, there is only small amount of examples. It may indicate that such methods only require small amount of data.

* 5 Nov 2024 [Large Language Models Orchestrating Structured Reasoning Achieve Kaggle Grandmaster Leve](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03562)
In this paper, LLM agent shows remarkable performance that achieving Kaggle Grandmaster in kaggle competition. It introduces a method to enhance the performance of LLM agent by utilizing the historical data.

* [OpenR: An Open Source Framework for Advanced Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09671)
This work release a light, integrated framework to facilitate the RL-based fine-tune of LLM.
